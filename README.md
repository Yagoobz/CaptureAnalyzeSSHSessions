- Assess Telnet security risks; discuss encryption.

<h3>Step 1: Account Creation and Telnet Connection</h3>
In this project, I'll delve into Telnet, contrasting it with its more secure counterpart, SSH. To demonstrate Telnet's functionality, I'll connect to a remote device, tty.sdf.org. To initiate the process, I'll create an account on the website, which will then provide login credentials via email.
