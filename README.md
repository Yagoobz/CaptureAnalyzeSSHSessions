<h3>Step 1: Capture Traffic Between Host and Remote Server</h3>
To initiate the capture of all traffic between myself and the remote server I plan to SSH into, I input "host tty.sdf.org" into the Wireshark capture filter. To generate SSH traffic, I utilize Windows PowerShell, providing my login credentials. Additionally, I generate Telnet traffic by entering the same username and password.
